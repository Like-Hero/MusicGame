 Version History
-----------------
* Items marked with the "[Pro]" tag are limited to the "Koreographer Professional Edition" package.

1.5.0 - Audio Scrubbing! Playback Anchor! Faster Zoom! Custom Payloads! Oh, and a sprinkling of bug fixes!

・[NEW] [PRO] Custom Payload support! With a flash of inspiration, we figured out how to enable you to supply your own Payload types to the Koreography system. Currently this requires that you also provide a custom KoreographyTrack class to contain them. See the Custom Payload Demo for documentation and a working example.
・[NEW] [PRO] New Demo: Custom Payload! Alongside the Custom Payload support, we've included a working example in the form of a demo package. This package includes detailed documentation of the feature and a working custom payload type: the MaterialPayload.
・[NEW] [PRO] New AssetPayload type! The AssetPayload can contain references to Prefabs, AudioClips, or any asset in the Project View.
・[NEW] Playback Anchor in the Koreography Editor! It is now possible to set a Playback Anchor in the Koreographer Editor. This allows you to specify the location to which the audio resets when playback is Stopped (via the stop button or with keyboard shortcuts). Access this feature by right-clicking on the waveform view.
・[NEW] Audio Scrubbing in the Koreography Editor! You can now hear a preview of the audio at any point in the waveform view by holding the ALT key and moving the mouse across the timeline. Please be aware that this feature is dependent upon the current zoom level.
・More responsive zooming! When zoomed out far enough, the Koreography Editor will automatically switch to a logarithmic zoom, enabling you to more quickly move through useful zoom levels.
・[PRO] Adjust the MIDI Converter to have a fixed width and minimum height to always show available content. The window metrics now match the design intent. Please let us know if this causes any usability issues.
・Fixed a number of locations in rarely used runtime code that could cause some unexpected allocations.
・Fix overwriting Koreography references when selecting duplicate objects with separate Koreography specified for a common Koreography field. The Koreography Property Drawer now properly supports reporting "multiple values" in these situations.
・Fix small bug in zoom level calculation.
・Fix the path used in New/Load operations on Koreography and KoreogrpahyTrack assets to properly point at the most-recently-used path, if one exists.
・Fix triggering the API Updater on Unity 5.6 and up when first importing Koreographer.
・[PRO] Fix an edge in the MIDI Converter wherein notes that would end-and-begin in the same instant (MIDI delta of 0) would be imported incorrectly.
・[PRO] Fix the contents of the tooltip for the Event ID in the Koreography Track Export tab of the MIDI Converter.

1.4.2 - Fix that stuttery Koreography Editor timeline in Unity 5.5.0+ and improve smoothness across all versions!

・[NEW] Added two basic example scenes for the PlayMaker integration to show Koreography Event handling with PlayMaker FSMs.
・Fix audio playback time estimation in the Koreography Editor. The code never really worked as expected. This was revealed by a bug introduced by Unity in Unity 5.5.0. Unity has been notified of the associated bug on their end.
・Minor documentation fixes.

1.4.1 - A strong serving of bug fixes! A pinch of optimizations! A dash of new features!

・[NEW] Overloaded the AudioVisor.ResyncTimings() API to take a specific sample time value. This helps guard against race conditions between the Main and Audio threads.
・[NEW] The AudioSourceVisor now has a ResyncTimings() API to enable notification about intentional changes to its AudioSource.
・[NEW] The AudioSourceVisor now has an [optional] "Target Audio Source" field in the Inspector. This removes the implicit requirement of having a single AudioSourceVisor per GameObject. To support this, the AudioSourceVisor no longer auto-adds an AudioSource to the GameObject when added in the Editor. If no AudioSource is specified in the "Target AudioSource" field and no AudioSource is attached to the same GameObject, the AudioSource will log a warning to the console and disable itself.
・[NEW] The AudioSourceVisor now has a ScheduledPlayTime property that enables proper event handling when using the AudioSource.PlayScheduled() APIs.
・[NEW] Brand new PlayMaker Action: Get Koreography Event Timing Offsets! This provides sub-frame timing accuracy for reported Koreography Events. Reported Timing Offsets are intended for OneOff events or only frames wherein the Start or End of a Span are processed.
・Improved the accuracy and reliability of internal timing calculations. This helps improve the reliability of event tracking when looping, as well as better accuracy when the engine is under heavy load.
・Fixes for the Event Delay system to ensure proper event ordering, as well as consistent and correct reporting of time slices.
・Fixes for event triggering when looping with Event Delay.
・Fix events triggering early when the MultiMusicPlayer is configured with a large Sync Play Delay.
・Fix to stop CurvePayload.GetValueAtDelta() from allocating memory.
・Fix AudioSourceVisor initialization incorrectly occurring in Start() instead of Awake().
・Fix the Event ID Tooltip for string fields marked with the [EventID] Attribute appearing over other fields and controls in the Inspector.
・Fix spamming the Console with errors in Unity 5.0+ when scrolling the waveform near the end of the loaded AudioClip in the Koreography Editor.
・Fix for certain Sample Delta functions being off by one sample.
・Very slight math optimizations in internal functionality (reduction in floating point division).
・Fixes to script API documentation (information shown by IntelliSense or equivalent).
・[Pro] Fix for the MIDI Converter not showing MIDI Tracks Converter that had only Lyrics in them. The "Channels" dropdown is not shown for MIDI Tracks that only contain Lyrics.
・[Pro] Fix to stop hiding the actual type of unhandled MIDI Status messages, providing better debug information with certain MIDI files.
・[Pro] Fix for the MIDI Converter incorrectly handling MIDI files with certain SysEx messages. This would cause the next MIDI Event's timing (as well as subsequent events) to be off by a large margin.
・[Pro] Fix script warnings in the Master Audio integration with newer versions of MonoDevelop.
・[Pro] Fix to properly support Master Audio's Gapless Playback and Crossfading playlist features.
・[Pro] Reorganized the SECTR Audio integration script hierarchy to better match other integrations.
・[Pro] Fix Fabric integration scripts polluting the global namespace. The Fabric visors are now properly in the SonicBloom.Koreo.Players.Fabric namespace.

1.4.0 - Rhythm Game Demo! Master Audio Integration! FFT Audio Analysis! Expanded APIs! More responsive!

・[NEW] Rhythm Game Demo showing how to create a game with simple rhythm gameplay! This also provides an example of using the Event Delay functionality to overcome issues related to audio latency.
・[NEW] [Pro] Master Audio integration! Supports both Koreography Event triggering and the Music Time APIs.
・[NEW] [Pro] New FFT Audio Analysis method! This includes a new Payload type (Spectrum Payload) that is generated by the FFT analysis and can be queried at runtime for frequency spectrum information! Check out the new functionality by opening the Analysis Panel and clicking the FFT tab!
・[NEW] [Pro] Lyric Meta Event support added to the MIDI Converter.
・[NEW] The Koreography Editor no longer snaps at the beginning and end of a song to the edges of the screen; the waveform no longer jumps when pausing playback.
・[NEW] Lots of new functions added to the Music Time API! Timings can now be accessed in Samples, Seconds, or Beats, and, yes, there's a BPM accessor!
・[NEW] Tempo Sections now support smooth tempo transitions! If the new "Start New Measure" flag is unchecked, the time-in-beats will pick up where the previous Tempo Section left off. [Pro] The MIDI Converter now unchecks this option by default, properly matching the way MIDI tempo changes are handled.
・[NEW] Timing calculations use 'double' instead of 'float' for far greater precision.
・[NEW] Report to the user if a previous Koreography processing pass did not finish properly. This can occur if an exception is thrown from within a callback.
・[NEW] The Koreography Editor playhead can now be moved by beat as well as by measure (hold down the shift key while pressing left/right).
・[NEW] Support waveform rendering on Retina and HiDPI displays in the Koreography Editor (Unity 5.4+).
・[NEW] The waveform can now be "scratched" in the Koreography Editor by dragging with the middle mouse button during playback.
・[NEW] Koreographer's Music Players now have an IsPlaying property to quickly check the status of playback.
・[NEW] Koreographer's Music Players now support setting a target Koreographer component with which to interface.
・[NEW] Loaded Koreography can now be queried from a Koreographer component.
・[NEW] Improved the portability and performance of the KoreographyTrack event retrieval functions. Old versions marked as Obsolete.

・Fix calculating Curve Payload deltas when the first key was not at time 0.
・Fix Audio Visor logic that used the global Koreographer component, ignoring a specified target Koreographer component.
・[Pro] Fix RMS Audio Analysis results not immediately appearing in the Koreography Editor when generated.
・[Pro] Fix an issue where Audio Analysis would fail to mark a Koreography Track as dirty when generating events.
・Fix not resetting internal Koreography time tracking values when loading a Koreography.
・Customized the script execution order of Koreographer's Audio Players to get them to update early.
・No longer allow creating Koreography Events beyond the end of the AudioClip.
・Removed the version of the GetAllEventsInRange API that had been previously marked as Obsolete.
・Remove reliance upon 'decimal' type in Koreographer functions.
